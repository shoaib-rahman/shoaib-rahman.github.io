    <h3>Future Plan</h3>
        <p>I plan to pursue a career in computer science. Computer scientists study theoretical and practical approaches to computation. They also work to design systems that enable the processing, communication and storage of information. I expect to spend some time working as a software developer. In the long term, I am interested in developing my own technology startup company. Computer science is very important to today's economy. The field of computer science is typically associated with the development of computer programs. Computer programs enable companies to conduct their business. Program improvements can have a very important influence over the ability of businesses to be efficient and successful. However, the field of computer science is not limited to programming. Networks, security protocols and computer networks are all created by computer science professionals. Furthermore, individuals with advanced computer science degrees may also go on to instruct the next generation of degree majors. In essence, individuals who earn computer science degrees develop skills that enable them to develop new products capable of revolutionizing the world.</p>
